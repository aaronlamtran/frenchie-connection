        "question": "Do crossbred or mixed breed French Bulldogs make good pets?",
        "answer": "Many do make good pets, yes, in the right homes. But before you choose ANY purebred, crossbreed, or mixed breed, you need to know what a purebred dog really IS and what crossbred and mixed breed dogs really are."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you help me decide whether the French Bulldog is the best breed for me?",
        "answer": "Yes, I offer personal consultations on choosing the best breed for your family and lifestyle.."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I reserve a puppy?",
        "answer": "Frenchie Collections requires a $600 deposit on all puppies as well as a puppy contract in order to reserve your puppy."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which shots will my puppy come with?",
        "answer": "The schedule of vaccinations that dogs really need has changed dramatically. Unfortunately most vets are not telling you the truth about this, because a good chunk of their income depends on frequent vaccinations. Please contact me for more information"
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the pros and cons of spaying and neutering my French Bulldog, and when should it be done?",
        "answer": "Spaying and neutering are often recommended too early, which can lead to health problems later in life."
