We were lucky to have found The Frenchie Connection when we were thinking about expanding our family to include another dog.  When we arrived at The Frenchie Connection, we were shown the puppies and the mother of the litter.  All the dogs seemed very happy, healthy and well cared for.  We were shown all the AKC papers for mom and puppies and were very comfortable that the pups were well bred.  We picked Jasper out because of his big personality and his handsomeness.  He is perfectly symmetrical and has beautiful markings. He joined our household seamlessly.  He was already pad trained and we were lucky enough to have my daughter hand raise him so he had plenty of attention the first months of his life.  We enrolled him in puppy training class and he absolutely loved it.  He was very attentive and learned some wonderful manners.  He gets along great with other dogs and with all the people he meets.  He is by far the most intelligent dog we have ever had and so loving too.  We are looking forward to picking out another puppy from The Frenchie Connection when the times comes to expand our family again and would highly recommend them if you are in the market for a wonderful French Bulldog.\"",

        "question": "Do crossbred or mixed breed French Bulldogs make good pets?",
        "answer": "Many do make good pets, yes, in the right homes. But before you choose ANY purebred, crossbreed, or mixed breed, you need to know what a purebred dog really IS and what crossbred and mixed breed dogs really are."

      {
        "question": "How do I reserve a puppy?",
        "answer": "Frenchie Collections requires a $600 deposit on all puppies as well as a puppy contract in order to reserve your puppy."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which shots will my puppy come with?",
        "answer": "The schedule of vaccinations that dogs really need has changed dramatically. Unfortunately most vets are not telling you the truth about this, because a good chunk of their income depends on frequent vaccinations. Please contact me for more information"

      {
        "question": "What are the pros and cons of spaying and neutering my French Bulldog, and when should it be done?",
        "answer": "Spaying and neutering are often recommended too early, which can lead to health problems later in life."
